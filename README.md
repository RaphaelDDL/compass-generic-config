compass-generic-config
======================

Easy editable config.rb file for compass, along with sourcemaps for development enviroment (requires `sass bleeding edge` and `compass-sourcemaps`) and sprites without hash on name (same name always `icon-sprites.png` for e.g. but hash used as cachebuster `icon-sprites.png?v=hashnum` for e.g.)
