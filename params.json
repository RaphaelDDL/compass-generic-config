{"name":"Compass-generic-config","tagline":"Easy editable config.rb file for compass, with config for both dev and prod environments and sourcemaps","body":"[compass-generic-config](http://raphaelddl.github.io/compass-generic-config)\r\n======================\r\n\r\nEasy editable config.rb file for Compass, now optionally integrated with Gruntjs and entirely configurable via package.json + grunt tasks.\r\n\r\n**Important**\r\nGot suggestions, Bugs, whatever? Feel free to make an Issue or Pull Request, it's a pleasure to receive them.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n#### Changelog\r\n* 0.5.1 - Implemented user_assets_folder, changed user_fonts_folder to assets' root, like most applications normally do, revamped Readme to reflect the changes\r\n* 0.4 - Revamped config, now integrated with Grunt.js\r\n* 0.3 - Added `user_sourcemaps`\r\n* 0.2 - Added `user_environment` instead of direct changes on `environment` setting.\r\n* 0.1 - Initial\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n## Gruntjs Integration\r\n\r\nIf you already use Grunt for your project, having sass/compass is really simple. Add `folderConfig` and the `user_xxxx_folder` like on my `package.json` file. That will guide not only config.rb itself but also `Gruntfile.js` if you are using my example settings for `grunt-contrib-compass`.\r\n\r\nIf you don't use Grunt.js, just get `package.json` and `config.rb`, editting `folderConfig` accordingly. The only thing you will need is to uncomment the `enviroment` var on `config.rb` - which if used in conjunction with Grunt, it's configured `on Gruntfile.js`, like my example task). The values for that var can be `:development` or `:production`.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n##Folder Structure used as Base\r\n\r\n\troot (where package.json/config.rb/Gruntfile.js has to be put)\r\n\t+--user_assets_folder\r\n\t\t|-- user_fonts_folder\r\n\t\t|-- user_image_folder\r\n\t\t|-- user_javascript_folder\r\n\t\t+-- user_css_folder\r\n\t\t\t+-- user_sass_folder\r\n\t\t\t\t+-- user_sasscache_folder\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more info, please refeer to the `sampleRoot` folder.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n##Development Environment Specifics\r\n\r\n* Expanded Output;\r\n* Line comments;\r\n* Create sourcemaps for all `.css` files as `.css.map`, used on Chrome DevTools for better CSS debug;\r\n(requires latest `sass bleeding edge` and latest `compass-sourcemaps` for `:development`'s sourcemaps to work)\r\n\r\n##Production Environment Specifics\r\n\r\n* Compressed Output;\r\n* No line comments;\r\n* Disable sourcemaps and remove all already created sourcemaps so they are not uploaded by mistake;\r\n\r\n##Both Environments\r\n\r\n####Compass sprite generation\r\nCompass creates a new sprite file everytime there's a change, by appending a hash to the filename. For TFS and other source controls, this is a pain (having to include/delete images all time from project), therefore:\r\n\r\n* sprites without hash on name  - name always the same (`icon-sprites.png` for e.g.);\r\n* Hash used as cachebuster instead (`icon-sprites.png?v=9999999` for e.g.)\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n##Configuration\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Step 0\r\nPut `config.rb`, `Gruntfile.js` and `package.json` on your project's root folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Step 1\r\nConfigure your folder's names. E.g.:\r\n\r\n\tuser_assets_folder = 'assets'\r\n\tuser_css_folder = 'css'\r\n\tuser_fonts_folder = 'fonts'\r\n\tuser_sass_folder = 'sass'\r\n\tuser_sasscache_folder = '_cache' //sass default is '.sass-cache'\r\n\tuser_image_folder = 'img'\r\n\tuser_javascript_folder = 'js'\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Step 2\r\nRun your grunt's environment type, considering you are using my tasks. E.g.:\r\n\r\nFor a watch (just like `compass watch`):\r\n\r\n\tgrunt dev\r\n\r\nFor run-once compile:\r\n\r\n\tgrunt compass:prod\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Step 3\r\n\r\nProfit (?!)\r\n\r\n\r\n##Knows Issues\r\nCompass Sprites using something like `@import \"{folderName}/*.png\"; @include all-{folderName}-sprites;` give `#public_url` error and sourcemaps will fail to be created/updated. Set `user_sourcemaps` to `false` on `package.json` to prevent that.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n####Thanks to:\r\n* You who read, use and/or help make it better by pushing things or creating issues\r\n* People who made Sass and Compass - [nex3](http://nex-3.com/) and [Chris](http://chriseppstein.github.com/) - and who contributed to it\r\n* People who made [Gruntjs](http://gruntjs.com) and who contributed to it\r\n* [Peter J Langley](http://www.codechewing.com/library/automatically-generate-css-sprites-with-sass/) for his sprite hash remover script used as base (as well as the tutorial itself. Go read it, it's good :D)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
