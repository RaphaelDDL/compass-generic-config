{"name":"Compass-generic-config","tagline":"Easy editable config.rb file for compass, with config for both dev and prod environments and sourcemaps","body":"[compass-generic-config](http://raphaelddl.github.io/compass-generic-config)\r\n======================\r\n\r\nEasy editable config.rb file for Compass\r\n\r\n##Folder Structure used as Base\r\n\r\n\troot (where config.rb has to be put)\r\n\t|-- user_css_folder\r\n\t|    |-- user_fonts_folder \r\n\t|    +-- user_sass_folder \r\n\t|         +-- user_sasscache_folder \r\n\t|-- user_css_folder\r\n\t|-- user_image_folder\r\n\t+-- user_javascript_folder\r\n\r\n##Development Environment Specifics\r\n\r\n* Expanded Output;\r\n* Line comments;\r\n* Create sourcemaps for all `.css` files as `.css.map`, used on Chrome DevTools for better CSS debug;\r\n(requires latest `sass bleeding edge` and latest `compass-sourcemaps` for `:development`'s sourcemaps to work)\r\n\r\n##Production Environment Specifics\r\n\r\n* Compressed Output;\r\n* No line comments;\r\n* Disable sourcemaps and remove all already created sourcemaps so they are not uploaded by mistake;\r\n\r\n##Both Environments\r\n\r\n####Compass sprite generation\r\nCompass creates a new sprite file everytime there's a change, by appending a hash to the filename. For TFS and other source controls, this is a pain (having to include/delete images all time from project), therefore:\r\n\r\n* sprites without hash on name  - name always the same (`icon-sprites.png` for e.g.);\r\n* Hash used as cachebuster instead (`icon-sprites.png?v=9999999` for e.g.)\r\n\r\n\r\n##Configuration\r\n  \r\n\r\n#### Step 0\r\nPut `config.rb` on your project's root folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Step 1\r\nConfigure your folder's names. E.g.:\r\n\r\n\tuser_css_folder = 'css'\r\n\tuser_fonts_folder = 'fonts'\r\n\tuser_sass_folder = 'sass'\r\n\tuser_sasscache_folder = '_cache' //sass default is '.sass-cache'\r\n\tuser_image_folder = 'img'\r\n\tuser_javascript_folder = 'js'\r\n  \r\n  \r\n#### Step 2\r\nConfigure your environment's type. E.g.:\r\n\r\n\tuser_environment = 'dev' ##or 'prod'. Defaults to prod if wrote wrong\r\n  \r\n  \r\n#### Step 3\r\nRun `compass watch` from your Ruby prompt *or any other tool that do the same ([Prepros](http://alphapixels.com/prepros/) with Full Compass Support on, for e.g.)*\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Step 4\r\nProfit (?!)\r\n\r\n\r\n##Knows Issues\r\nCompass Sprites using something like `@import \"{folderName}/*.png\"; @include all-{folderName}-sprites;` give `#public_url` error and sourcemaps will fail to be created/updated.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Etc\r\nGot suggestions, Bugs, whatever? Feel free to make an Issue or Pull Request.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to:\r\n* People who made Sass and Compass ([nex3](http://nex-3.com/) and [Chris](http://chriseppstein.github.com/) <3)\r\n* [Peter J Langley](http://www.codechewing.com/library/automatically-generate-css-sprites-with-sass/) for his sprite hash remover script used as base (as well as the tutorial itself. Go read the link, it's good :D)\r\n* You who read, use and/or help make it better\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
